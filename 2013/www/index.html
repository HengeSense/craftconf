    <p itemprop="description"><strong>First you grew. Now you lead. Join us at Stretch in Budapest this December and get inspired by stories from leads and founders of great organisations as they talk about the challenges of leadership and management.</strong></p>


<p>Stretch will feature leads, founders, CTOs, and CEOs sharing their real world stories on their success and failure. They’ll talk about the challenges of building successful teams and scaling up organizations from 20 to 200. Get inspired by stories from companies that have been digital and agile from day one and hear how they managed to implement the language of change as well as establishing a culture of feedback.</p>

<p>A conference for everyone that knows startups are not about magic fridges, ping-pong tables and free food. Come and connect with the people behind the curtains and learn more about the tools and frameworks of a successful manager. Join the conference to connect with leads and aspiring leads in your industry who struggle with the same problems you do. Once you’ve found each other, there’s a chance you might find some solutions too.</p>
